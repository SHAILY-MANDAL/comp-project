Grocery Store Management System 

This Python project provides a basic framework for managing a grocery store's inventory and generating invoices. It allows users (store staff) to:

Add new items: Create new entries in the grocery database, specifying product name, price, quantity, and (optional) a category.
View items: List all items in the inventory database, displaying details like name, price, quantity, and category.
Delete items: Remove specific items from the inventory database, ensuring accurate stock tracking.
Generate invoices: Create invoices for customer purchases, calculating total cost and providing an itemized list.
